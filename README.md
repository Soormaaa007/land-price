## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as **location, size, number of bedrooms, and other factors**. The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that accurately estimates house prices using **regression algorithms**.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains various attributes affecting house prices, such as:  
- 🛏️ **Number of Bedrooms**  
- 🚿 **Number of Bathrooms**  
- 📏 **Square Footage**  
- 🏗️ **Year Built**  
- 📍 **Location**  
- 🚗 **Garage, Pool, and Other Features**  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Then, clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git  
cd house-price-prediction  
```

## 🚀 Usage  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Load the dataset and explore its features.  
3. Perform **data preprocessing** (handle missing values, encode categorical data, feature scaling).  
4. Train the model using **Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost**.  
5. Evaluate model performance using **RMSE, R² score, and MAE**.  

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **XGBoost (if applicable)**  

## 📈 Performance Metrics  
The model is evaluated using:  
✅ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
✅ **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
✅ **R² Score**  

## 🏆 Future Improvements  
- Improve feature engineering for better accuracy.  
- Implement **Deep Learning models** (e.g., Neural Networks).  
- Use **real-time data** for dynamic price predictions.
